As of version : Beta 1

Objective-PHP (the parser/runtime)
----------------------------------
The parser is relatively robust. However it still lacks certain features see the [Roadmap](Roadmap.html)
for more on what is planned when.

The runtime is also relatively stable, but is subject to some changes.

This is a list of language features supported/in development/not supported
by Objective-PHP.

### Supported

* Categories
* Protocols

### Partial

* @accessors : To create get/set methods for object ivars.

### Not Yet Implemented

* `@"string"` : To shorthand initialise MKString objects.
* `@_(number)_` : To shorthand initialise MKNumber objects.
* Static type hinting.
* `@synthesize`
* Archiving


Moka (the framework)
--------------------
Is in early days. The ported elements are from Foundation.

See [Moka](Moka.html) for details.

However I will now work alot on this to try get much more of Foundation ported.

Compiler
--------

Currently lacking support for applications that do dynamic imports (imports that are resolved at
runtime).

The compiler also lacks any optimisation (like removal of methods that are never used). However this
is planned.
