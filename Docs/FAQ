Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

Here is a short list of FAQs. Please feel free to [contact](/Contact) me with
other questions.

The FAQ is split into a set of technical questions and then a set of general questions.

Technical Questions
-------------------

_Q: Why `super` and not `$super`?_

    A: From Apple: "super is simply a flag to the compiler telling it where to begin searching for
    the method to perform; it s used only as the receiver of a message. But self is a variable name
    that can be used in any number of ways, even assigned a new value." Hence $super doesnt exist,
    $self does, and in the case of Objective-PHP is the same as $this. $self and $this however are
    parsed into $_op_obj , a special object pointer passed to each method pointing to the instance
    object instance.

_Q: What about Static Typing?_

    A: Static typing is not supported in Objective-PHP. Declare variables as you would in PHP.

_Q: Does Objective-PHP support Dot Syntax, `.`?_

    A: No and yes. The `.` operator does not work; (it would clash with the concat operator) instead
    use the `->` object operator which is inherintely part of PHP. If you have an instance of an
    object `$obj` with an ivar `$x` then you can get/set it with `$obj->x`.
    But NOTE: in Objective-C the Dot Syntax compiles into accessor method calls. Hence
    `anObject.anIvarThatIsAnObject.anotherIvar` is perfectly valid even if `anIvarThatIsAnObject` is
    `nil` (as the getter method for `anotherIvar` is sent to a `nil` object which is perfectly
    valid) but in PHP `$anObject->anIvarThatIsAnObject->anotherIvar` will throw a runtime error is
    `anIvarThatIsAnObject` is `nil` as in this case you are directly accessing the ivar.

General Questions
-----------------

_Q: **Why?** PHP is so great, this is an abomination, how dare you.... (etc)_

    A: Because of the reasons stated [here](About.html) and a) if you want to learn
    something well, implement its runtime! b) because I like.
    Enough said.

_Q: **Why?** PHP is rubbish and you are nothing but a script kiddie._

    A: OK. See Q1.

_Q: Can I help develop this?_

    A: Yes, please. Help out by contributing code or testing.

_Q: What version of PHP does this require?_

    A: The current implementation requires 5.3.x ... When PHP 6 is
    officially released the project will adopt it.

_Q: What is the prefered file extension?_

    A: `.op` for Objective-PHP.

_Q: (Flame/Troll/Hate)_

    A: OK.
