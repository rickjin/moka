Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

Here is a short list of FAQs. Please feel free to [contact](/Contact) me with
other questions.

_Q: **Why?** PHP is so great, this is an abomination, how dare you.... (etc)_

    A: Because of the reasons stated [here](About.html) and a) if you want to learn
    something well, implement its runtime! b) because I like.
    Enough said.

_Q: **Why?** PHP is rubbish and you are nothing but a script kiddie._

    A: OK. See Q1.

_Q: Can I help develop this?_

    A: Yes, please. Help out by contributing code or testing.

_Q: What version of PHP does this require?_

    A: The current implementation requires 5.3.x ... When PHP 6 is
    officially released the project will adopt it.

_Q: What is the license of projects created using Objective-PHP and Moka?_

    A: It is released under the Lesser GNU GPL meaning anything using it can
    be closed source and commercial but any changes to the runtime/parser/
    Moka etc (any code in the Objective-PHP/Moka distribution) must be open
    source. [See here for more on the LGPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html).

_Q: Why `super` and not `$super`?

    A: From cocoa docs "super is simply a flag to the compiler telling it where to begin searching for
    the method to perform; it s used only as the receiver of a message. But self is a variable name
    that can be used in any number of ways, even assigned a new value." Hence $super doesnt exist,
    $self does, and in the case of Objective-PHP is the same as $this. $self and $this however are
    parsed into $_op_obj , a special object pointer passed to each method pointing to the instance
    object instance.

_Q: (Flame/Troll/Hate)_

    A: OK.
