Import
======

Importing can be at preprocess time or at runtime.

To import code at preprocess time (and when compiling these files are automatically included
into the build):

    @import <file path in framework folders>

or

    @import "file path relative to current locaiton"

*Note*: the lack of semicolon on the end of the line.

You can import code at runtime too. This is done by:

    @import $variable

Where `$variable` is a string of a file path. *Note Well*: at the moment the file path
is always relative to the current location (or absolute if given as an absolute path).

For Beta 1:
-----------
*Compiling with runtime imports is NOT supported.*
