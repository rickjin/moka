What are the differences between Objective-PHP and Objective-C?
===============================================================

If you are coming from an Objective-C background you should read this list. I
want this list to a detailed an exhaustive list of differences so please
[Contact me](http://groups.google.com/group/objective-php) if anything is missing.


* Message `-initialise` is sent to each object, top down (parents first), when
  they are first created, which will be when the first reference to them is
  encountered (as `getInstance` will be called by the runtime). This will only
  happen though when the object is about to be used so it still effectively
  implements the lazy initialization. In ObjC the call is made first time a
  message is sent. The difference is subtle but there. The ObjPHP way you do not
  need to check the initialised flag everytime you call `objphp_msgSend` so this
  should help performance (in ObjC initialised is checked everytime `msgSend` is
  called).

* Classes are created using `@implementation` only (no use of `@interface`). This
  follows the logic of the Objective-J developers, that @interface is really
  not necessary and all the methods plus class definition can be contained
  in @implementation.


* Getter/Setter methods for properties are created with `@accessors`. `@synthesize`, `@dynamic` and
  `@property` have no correlate. [Read on Cappuccino.org for more on `@accessors`](http://cappuccino.org/discuss/2008/10/26/synthesizing-accessor-methods/)
