About Protocols in Objective-PHP
--------------------------------

A protocol is a mechanism of providing guarantees for objects. Effectively a protocol is adopted
by an object (or an object expects another object to adopt a certain protocol) hopefully guaranteeing
the existance in that object of certain methods defined by the protocol.

For example a protocol `A` specifies there should be an instance method `mustHaveMe` in any class
which adopts it

    @protocol A
    - mustHaveMe;
    @end

now if a class `Class` adopts protocol `A` it must have a method `mustHaveMe` somewhere in it or
its inheritance chain.

    @implementation Class <A>
    - (void)mustHaveMe
    {
        echo "I obey!\n";
    }
    @end

[For a better description see this page.](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/ocProtocols.html)

As in Objective-C, in ObjPHP protocols too are first class objects. They are subclasses of the root
object `MKObject` and `Protocol`.
The actual implementation is an ObjPHP class (so it consists of 3 PHP classes, one for the protocols
instance object, one for the class object and one for the meta class object).

For each class that adopts protocols a table is created of protocol names which is checked for
conformance at compile time and if the class is missing any methods an exception is thown.
Objective-C doesnt produce an error if the protocol is not obeyed so to align Objective-PHP with
Objective-C this may change.
