Problems and Limitations of Objective-PHP
=========================================

Problem: PHP/Objective-PHP Syntax Conflicts
-------------------------------------------

Unfortunately there is a syntactic conflict with PHP (see
[the Tokenizer page](Tokenizer.html) for more details).

Limitation: Timers in PHP
-------------------------

One of the stumbling points of PHP as a general purpose programming language is
the lack of a timing system (real-time functionality).

In PHP timing can be achieved through polling the system time
(microsecond accuracy) at given 'ticks' where a tick is the execution of 1 PHP
instruction. Ie after a certain number of instructions are executed a method
can be called to check the time and update or fire any timers.

However its not hard to see that this is far from ideal. You must trade off
accuracy for performance (as for high accuracy of timer time outs the poll
method must constantly fire hence slowing the overall script execution time).

I really hope this is addressed in the future but its unlikely.

However there are many applications where accurate timing is not necessary
(e.g. in a website MVC backend) so this may not be a problem for most target
applications).

Limitation: Lack of Type Bridging
---------------------------------

In Obj-J Javascript types are toll-free bridged to Cappuccino equivalents.
Unfortunately in PHP the native types are _not_ objects (in this sense PHP is
much less OO than JS) and so such simple toll-free bridging is not possible.
In this sense Moka is more like Cocoa than Cappuccino.
