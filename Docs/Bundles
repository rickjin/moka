About the Bundle model of Objective-PHP
=======================================

Bundles will allow configuration and resource handling for your applications,
including support for localization. The file 'info.plist' provides the PList
format bundle information.

This support is hopefully planned soon. See the [Roadmap](Roadmap.html) for more.
