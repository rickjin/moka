Categories in Objective-PHP
===========================


About Categories
----------------

Categories allow the programmer to add methods to classes at runtime. Once a
method is added to a class via a Category it is available to all instances of
objects of that class from then on. Another important factor of Categories is
that they allow the programmer to add methods to classes which are defined in
external Frameworks or libraries.

Both class and instance methods can be added to objects, and new instance
variables cannot be defined. This is a restriction of Objective-C (as once a
class has been compiled its ivars become a C struct of which one is created per
class instance and hence adding new ivars at runtime would mean having to change
the size of this struct, and this isn't trivial. Since this restriction does not
exist in PHP it would be possible to add ivars via Categories but this features
is not currently planned).

Categories override methods with the same Selector that are already defined in
a class.

In ObjPHP categories are implemented in a way that means as the parser comes
across a definition of one, it creates the necessary runtime calls in the output
source to thus add the new methods to the specified objects at runtime.

Implementation Detail
---------------------

* An anonymous function is created with the method definition given.
* The method handle is added to the Class object into the Dispatch Table using
  `addMethodWithMethodName()` defined in `_runtimeclass`, see
  [Runtime](Runtime.html) for more).

* Now when `objphp_msgSend` is called to send a message (and asks the receiver if
  it has the method that implements the given message), the dispatch table
  is checked and the message is either called from the pointer there or from the
  actual class methods (the ones that were known at compile time). Since categories
  can only be added after the class has been defined categories implicity override
  methods defined in the class.
